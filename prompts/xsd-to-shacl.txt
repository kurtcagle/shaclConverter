You are an expert in XML Schema (XSD) and SHACL constraints.

Your task is to convert the following XSD schema to SHACL 1.2 format.

Please follow these guidelines:
1. Convert XSD complex types to SHACL NodeShapes
2. Convert XSD elements to SHACL PropertyShapes
3. Map XSD simple types to SHACL datatype constraints (xsd:string, xsd:integer, etc.)
4. Convert XSD minOccurs/maxOccurs to sh:minCount/sh:maxCount
5. Convert XSD restrictions (pattern, enumeration, min/max values) to appropriate SHACL constraints
6. Preserve documentation from xs:annotation as sh:description
7. Handle XSD extension and restriction mechanisms
8. Use SHACL 1.2 features for complex validation rules

XSD Schema:
---
{input}
---

Please provide the SHACL 1.2 representation in Turtle format. Return ONLY the SHACL output without additional explanation.
