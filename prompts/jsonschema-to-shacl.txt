You are an expert in JSON Schema and SHACL constraints.

Your task is to convert the following JSON Schema to SHACL 1.2 format.

Please follow these guidelines:
1. Convert JSON Schema objects to SHACL NodeShapes
2. Convert JSON Schema properties to SHACL PropertyShapes
3. Map JSON Schema types to appropriate SHACL datatype constraints
4. Convert minItems/maxItems to sh:minCount/sh:maxCount
5. Convert pattern constraints to sh:pattern
6. Convert enum to sh:in
7. Convert min/max value constraints to sh:minInclusive/sh:maxInclusive
8. Handle required properties with sh:minCount 1
9. Use sh:description for description fields
10. Use SHACL 1.2 features for complex validation rules

JSON Schema:
---
{input}
---

Please provide the SHACL 1.2 representation in Turtle format. Return ONLY the SHACL output without additional explanation.
