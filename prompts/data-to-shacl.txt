You are an expert in data modeling and SHACL constraints.

Your task is to analyze the following data source and generate a SHACL 1.2 schema that validates data of this structure.

Please follow these guidelines:
1. Analyze the data structure and identify entities/classes
2. Create SHACL NodeShapes for each identified entity type
3. Create SHACL PropertyShapes for each property/field
4. Infer appropriate data types from the data values
5. Infer cardinality constraints (sh:minCount, sh:maxCount) based on data patterns
6. Identify patterns and create sh:pattern constraints where applicable
7. Add value constraints (sh:minInclusive, sh:maxInclusive) based on observed ranges
8. Use sh:in for enumerated values when the set appears fixed
9. Use SHACL 1.2 features for complex validation rules
10. Provide meaningful sh:name and sh:description based on field names and content

Data Source (format: {format}):
---
{input}
---

Please provide a SHACL 1.2 schema in Turtle format that would validate data of this structure. Return ONLY the SHACL output without additional explanation.
