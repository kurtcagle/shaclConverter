You are an expert in SHACL constraint languages.

Your task is to upgrade the following SHACL 1.0 file to SHACL 1.2 format.

Please follow these guidelines:
1. Preserve all existing SHACL 1.0 constraints (they remain valid in 1.2)
2. Update to use SHACL 1.2 features where beneficial:
   - Use sh:rule for derivation rules
   - Use sh:expression for SHACL-SPARQL expressions
   - Use sh:parameter for parameterizable constraints
   - Use sh:ask for boolean validation queries
3. Optimize validation rules using SHACL 1.2 compact syntax where applicable
4. Ensure backward compatibility
5. Add any missing namespace declarations for SHACL 1.2

SHACL 1.0:
---
{input}
---

Please provide the upgraded SHACL 1.2 representation in Turtle format. Return ONLY the SHACL output without additional explanation.
