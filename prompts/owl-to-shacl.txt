You are an expert in semantic web technologies, OWL ontologies, and SHACL constraints.

Your task is to convert the following OWL ontology to SHACL 1.2 format.

Please follow these guidelines:
1. Convert OWL classes to SHACL NodeShapes
2. Convert OWL properties to SHACL PropertyShapes
3. Map OWL restrictions and cardinality constraints to SHACL constraints
4. Preserve class hierarchies using sh:targetClass
5. Convert data type properties to appropriate SHACL datatype constraints
6. Convert object properties to appropriate SHACL node constraints
7. Use SHACL 1.2 features including sh:rule, sh:expression where appropriate
8. Include documentation from rdfs:label and rdfs:comment as sh:name and sh:description

OWL Ontology:
---
{input}

Please provide the SHACL 1.2 representation in Turtle format. Return ONLY the SHACL output without additional explanation.
